		Avoiding human-caused animal suffering, reducing our impact on the environment, fighting air and water pollution, cutting out toxins and cholesterol, standing up against world hunger, among others, are the mostly known reasons why people are increasingly choosing to switch to a vegan diet. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Nonetheless, <span>there are more reasons, in the practical sense, which are great potential benefits for any person who is after an easier and more productive lifestyle.</span>
	</p>

	<h1>A diet without animal products is less expensive</h1>
	<p>
		New research has shown that vegan and vegetarian diets cause a significant reduction to our food bill costs. When comparing the cost of seven sustainable diets like vegan and vegetarian to the current typical diet in 150 countries, <span>Oxford University researchers found that vegan diets were the most affordable and reduced food costs by up to one-third.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		Another study, published in the Journal of Hunger & Environmental Nutrition in 2012, found that vegetarians spend an average of $750 less on food per year than their meat-eating counterparts, a number that’s likely even higher today.
	</p>
	<p>
		But there’s so much more to the cost of a diet than the amount you spend on groceries every week. <span>The bigger picture encompasses the rising healthcare costs associated with eating too much meat and other animal products.</span> One recent study estimated that if Americans actually ate according to the recommended dietary guidelines, the country could save $180 billion in healthcare costs — and $250 billion if they gave up animal products altogether.
	</p>
	<p>
		
	</p>
	<h1>Defrosting becomes easier</h1>
	<p>
		Not surprising, as frozen meals bring multiple benefits compared to fresh food: higher affordability, better retention of vitamins and minerals, and extended expiration dates. By freezing the product, we help reducing food waste and make better use of our precious resources, and we also prevent the growth of microorganisms, such as yeasts, moulds and harmful bacteria, that can cause food spoilage and foodborne illnesses. But freezing with good results can be a challenge. <span>Fortunately, most vegetables can be cooked without thawing.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		Vegan meals that will need thawing are usually meat replacements, such as hamburguers and meatballs, or frozen vegetables bags. These foods take much less time to defrost than regular meat, and there are fewer risks if defrosting is done incorrectly. <span>Eating food with no proper thawing is one of the most common causes of food poisoning and other bacteria related deseases.</span>
	</p>

	<h1>Food will less likely get spoiled</h1>
	<p>
		If you leave meat out on the counter for a day, you have to throw it out, at least according to the FDA. <span>Fruit and veggies can be left out for days at a time and they'll stay good, if not quite as fresh.</span> Kept cold (not frozen), meat lasts a couple of days, fruit and vegetables close to a week, depending on the plant part in question.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is because meat is basically muscle tissue without any integumentary barrier (like skin) between the component cell membranes and the environment. Microorganisms (and, for that matter, animals) just have to punch through a lipid bilayer studded with proteins and they're in. Plant cells usually have cell walls made of a variety of tough polymers, and often fruit and veg are presented in their initial form with whatever additional organ-level integument they've got intact.
