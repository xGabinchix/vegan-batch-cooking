		Batch cooking is a meal preparation method that involves cooking a lot of food at one time and then storing it for later use. As the name suggests, <span>the food is cooked in batch and then stored in airtight containers and either kept in the refrigerator or the freezer until it is ready to be eaten.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		Batch cooking usually involves doubling, tripling or quadrupling the ingredients for a recipe of a specific meal.
	</p>
	<h1>Batch cooking saves time</h1>
	<p>
		<span>Batching cooking is an efficient way to prepare food as all the ingredients can be purchased, prepared and cooked at the same time.</span> It can help you to save the time and effort associated with food preparation and mean that you are cooking less often.
	</p>
	<p>
		Batch cooking can help you to save time spent preparing your meals, cooking and cleaning every day. You can simply defrost your chosen meal and ensure you are eating healthy, nutritious meals every day.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can choose to batch cook all your meals in advance or only some of them. After a busy day at work, <span>you will always have home-cooked, healthy meals pre-prepared in your fridge or freezer.</span> It can help you to maintain a healthy, balanced diet every day, no matter how busy you are.	
	</p>
	<p>
		As you will only be preparing and cooking food once or twice a week, this will significantly reduce the amount of cleaning you will need to do. Regular cooking will mean you need to thoroughly clean equipment, utensils and surfaces every day. Batch cooking will mean you just need to do a deep clean once a week.
	</p>
	<h1>Batch cooking helps you eat more healthily</h1>
	<p>
		After a long day at work or socialising, finding the energy to cook can be difficult and many people resort to takeaways, eating out or microwaveable ready meals. <span>By having batch cooked food stored in your fridge or freezer, you are less likely to eat impulsively, saving you money and helping you to eat more healthily.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>When you batch cook food, you are more likely to incorporate healthy and nutritious ingredients.</span> Cooking healthy meals every day can be time consuming and take a lot of energy and many people find it difficult to stick to daily. Batch cooking nutritious meals means you will always have access to healthy meals in your home.
	</p>
	<h1>Batch cooking is perfect for serving many people</h1>
	<p>
		This method of cooking is ideal for the mom entrepreneur who is usually so busy to make a healthy meal for her family everyday. <span>Batch cooking is a great way to make sure that you always have a home-cooked meal on hand, even when you’re short on time.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>Batch cooking is a great way to get the entire family involved in the kitchen.</span> If you have older kids, they can help with chopping vegetables or measuring ingredients. And, if you have younger kids, they can help with stirring or pouring. Involving your kids in the cooking process not only saves you time but also helps them to develop a love for cooking. As they get older, they’ll be able to take on more responsibility and eventually cook meals on their own.
