		Batch cooking doesn't have to be hard or take a whole day. Here you will find some <span>tips</span> that will help you plan the perfect batch cooking meals for a week. 
	</p>

	<h1>1) Make a plan</h1>
	<p>
		Take some tima and decide which recipes you're going to cook and how much you want to make. Make sure you have enough space in your fridge or freezer. Stews, soups and pasta bakes are classic freezable dishes. You can also freeze part of a meal, such as meatballs to eat with fresh pasta.
	</p>

	<h1>2) Containers</h1>
	<p>
		It's not much fun doing a big cook up to find there aren’t enough containers. Prepare enough freezer-safe containers or bags in the right sizes before getting started.
	</p>
	<img class="tips" src="img/get2.jpg">
	
	<h1>3) Undercook some ingredients</h1>
	<p>
		Your meals will get a second round of cooking when they're reheated, so slightly under-cook your veg to prevent them from going mushy. The same goes for rice and pasta.
	</p>
	<img class="tips" src="img/get3.jpg">
	
	<h1>4) Cool foods</h1>
	<p>
		Once your recipes are ready, it’s important to cool them completely before freezing portions.This avoids heating up other foods in your freezer. Once your food is at room temperature, or it's been cooling on the counter for two hours, freeze immediately to prevent growth of bacteria.
	</p>
	<img class="tips" src="img/get4.jpg">
	
	<h1>5) Clean as you go</h1>
	<p>
		If you’re making several recipes at once, tidying as you go will help your kitchen stay under control – no one wants to face a mountain of washing-up at the end!
	</p>
	<img class="tips" src="img/get5.jpg">
	
	<h1>6) Keep your freezer organised</h1>
	<p>
		Once you’ve mastered the art of batch cooking, your freezer will be filled with beautifully homecooked food that you can defrost and reheat whenever you need a quick meal.
	</p>
	<img class="tips" src="img/get6.jpg">
	
	<h1>7) Organize weekly</h1>
	<p>
		You can arrange meals for a couple of days or even monthly, but we recommend you organize your batch cooking meals weekly. That means you must choose a day of the week to prepare all the meals.
	</p>
	<img class="tips" src="img/get7.jpg">
	
	<h1>8) Breakfasts don't count</h1>
	<p>
		It is recommended not to prepare breaktfasts in advanced, since this will increase the cooking workload and more likely discourage you. Try arranging breakfasts that don't need any cooking: yogurt, bread, milk, cereal, etc. are good options.
	</p>
	<img class="tips" src="img/get8.jpg">
	
	<h1>9) Sunday doesn't count</h1>
	<p>
		Life is too short to be planning every single second of it! Ideally you should leave one day of the week out of your weekly meal plan. You can take this chance to eat out, order takeout or eat the leftovers of the week. This will also be the day reserved for planning and batch cooking the meals for the week.
